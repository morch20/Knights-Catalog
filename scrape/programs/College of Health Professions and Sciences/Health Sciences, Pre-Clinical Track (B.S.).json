If it will not be possible to complete the sequence before transferring, the student should postpone beginning the course until enrolling at UCF.\nStudents who take Anatomy and Physiology at a Florida College System institution may be required to complete additional upper division credits to meet the University graduation requirement of 42 credit hours of upper division (3000-4000) level credits.\nAcceptable Substitutes for Transfer Courses\nBSC 2010C - Biology I can be substituted by Biology I with Lab (BSC 1010 and BSC 1010L).\nBSC 2011C - Biology II can be substituted by Biology II with Lab (BSC 1011 and BSC 1011L).\nCHM 2045C - Chemistry Fundamentals I can be substituted by CHM 1045 and Lab.\nCHM 2046 - Chemistry Fundamentals II and CHM 2046L - Chemistry Fundamentals Laboratory can be substituted by CHM 1046 and Lab.\nPHY 2053C - College Physics I can be substituted by PHY 1053 and Lab.\nPHY 2054C - College Physics II can be substituted by PHY 1054 and Lab.\nZOO 3733C - Human Anatomy and PCB 3703C - Human Physiology can be substituted by Human Anatomy and Physiology I & II (BSC X093 and X094 or BSC X085 and X086). Please note that these acceptable transfer courses do not fulfill the 42 hours of upper division (3000-4000) credit required by UCF for graduation.\nStudents that transfer with an AA degree and will be pursuing a BS degree must meet the University foreign language admission requirements for graduation.\nProgram Academic Learning Compacts\nProgram Academic Learning Compacts (student learning outcomes) for undergraduate programs are located at: https://oeas.ucf.edu/doc/chps/alc_chps_health_sciences_bs.pdf"}}, "links": {"text": {"https://ucf.steppingblocks.com/": "https://ucf.steppingblocks.com/", "https://oeas.ucf.edu/doc/chps/alc_chps_health_sciences_bs.pdf": "https://oeas.ucf.edu/doc/chps/alc_chps_health_sciences_bs.pdf"}, "url": {"https://ucf.steppingblocks.com/": "https://ucf.steppingblocks.com/", "https://oeas.ucf.edu/doc/chps/alc_chps_health_sciences_bs.pdf": "https://oeas.ucf.edu/doc/chps/alc_chps_health_sciences_bs.pdf"}}}}}, "buttons": ["MCB - Microbiology", "CHM - Chemistry", "BCH - Biochemistry", "ZOO - Zoology", "CLP - Clinical Psychology", "SYO - Sociology--Social Organizations", "PCB - Process Cell Biology", "PET - Physical Education Theory", "HSC - Health Science", "HUN - Human Nutrition"]}
