Be sure that you take advantage of both.\nTransfer Notes\nLower division courses do not substitute for upper division courses.\n\nCourses transferred must be formally evaluated for equivalency credit. The student must provide a course syllabus and any other supporting information with his/her petition for this evaluation.\n\nCommon Program Prerequisites for the State University System for College of Business Administration programs include Financial Accounting, Managerial Accounting, Macroeconomics, Microeconomics, Calculus, Statistics, and a relevant computer class. At UCF Business, students who have completed the calculus and statistics class will be waived from Quantitative Business Tools I. Students who have completed either the calculus or the statistics, but not both, must take Quantitative Business Tools I.\n\nSubject to the general grade and residence requirements, credit will be granted for transferred course work equivalent to that required in the UCF Business program. Only grades of \"C\" (2.0) or higher transfer into the program and students must have a \"C\"(2.0) or better in each common program prerequisite class.\n\nAny student receiving a business degree must complete a minimum of 30 of the 60 upper level business credit hours for their degree program in the UCF College of Business Administration. Additionally, 12 of the 30 credit hours completed at UCF must be from the department or school in which the student majors.\nAcceptable Substitutes for Transfer Courses\nNone\nProgram Academic Learning Compacts\n\nProgram Academic Learning Compacts (student learning outcomes) for undergraduate programs are located at: http://www.oeas.ucf.edu/alc/academic_learning_compacts.htm"
