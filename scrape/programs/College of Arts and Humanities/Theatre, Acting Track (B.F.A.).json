Drawing upon the teachings of Stanislavski-based methodologies, as well as other successful practical acting techniques, the professional acting program offers an organic approach to performance training. The program begins with a focus on the fundamentals of acting: development of imagination, selfawareness, improvisation, voice production/diction and movement.

The training then moves to an emphasis on characterization, character development and studio training/scene study. This practical study, drawn from the total range of dramatic literature, provides the student with performance experiences ranging from the classical to the contemporary, including verse and musical theatre.
