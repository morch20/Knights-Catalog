Each student should seek academic advisement before registering for classes each semester to minimize excess hours and to ensure that satisfactory academic progress is being maintained.\nThe Construction Engineering program offers the opportunity for exceptionally well qualified undergraduates to enter directly into the PhD program after completion of an appropriate BS degree. This option allows outstanding undergraduates to begin planning a research program with a specific faculty advisor even before finishing the BS, and may allow completion of the PhD in a shorter time period than by taking a separate Master's followed by the PhD.\nThis Construction Engineering program has potential ties to professional licensure or certification in the field. For more information on how this program may prepare you in that regard, please visit https://apq.ucf.edu/files/Licensure-Disclosure-CECS-Construction-Engineering-BS.pdf\nTransfer Notes\nCourses transferred must be formally evaluated for equivalency credit. The student must provide all supporting information with his/her petition for this evaluation.\nEGS 1006C and EGN 1007C are required courses for incoming freshmen only. The credits for these two courses (one hour for each) may, with prior approval of the department academic advisor, be moved to the Restricted Elective area.\nAcceptable Substitutes for Transfer Courses\nNone\nProgram Academic Learning Compacts\nProgram Academic Learning Compacts (student learning outcomes) for undergraduate programs are located at: http://www.oeas.ucf.edu/alc/academic_learning_compacts.htm\nEquipment Fees\nPart-Time Student: $43 per term\nFull-Time Student: $85 per term"}, "courseSection8": {"header": "Plan of Study (128 Credit Hours)", "text": "Plan of Study (128 Credit Hours)\n\nThe tentative course schedule listed below is a guide for those students who plan on completing their degree in four years.
